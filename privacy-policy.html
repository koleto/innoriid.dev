        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Location information</strong>: With your permission, we collect precise location information from your device, including background location access, to show the position of measurement sources and to provide mapping features. Background location access is specifically used to record GPS coordinates in measurement log files while you perform backpack radiation surveys, even when your phone screen is locked. This location data:
                • Is only collected during active measurement sessions
                • Is stored locally in log files on your device
                • Can be shared with experts as part of measurement logs when you explicitly choose to export them for evaluation
            This location data is never transmitted to our company or any third parties unless included in measurement logs that you explicitly choose to share. You have full control over whether to save, delete, or share this location information.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage data</strong>: We collect information about how you use the App, including the features you use, the time spent on the App, and other usage statistics.</li>
            <li><strong>Bluetooth data</strong>: With your permission, we collect information about nearby Bluetooth devices to connect with compatible radiation detection equipment.</li>

These images are stored locally on your device and can be included in reports that you choose to share via email with experts for evaluation. You have full control over whether to save or delete these images.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Show the position of measurement sources on maps</li>
            <li>Allow you to take and store pictures of radiation sources</li>
            <li>Enable you to share measurement data, including location and images, via email with experts for evaluation (only when you choose to do so)</li>
            <li>Send notifications about alerts, warnings, and device status</li>
